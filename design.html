            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                This website was designed with a Mobile-First Responsive Web Design approach. The main goal is to create a cheerful, user-friendly, and visually engaging site aimed at the University of Sheffield students and visitors.
                The design was made to provide a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring accessibility and ease of navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The overall design focuses on simplicity, clean aesthetics, and a pleasant user experience, which aligns with the goal of offering users an intuitive and enjoyable campus guide.

        <!-- Menu System Section -->
        <article class="design-content">
            <h1>Menu System</h1>
            <p>
                For the menu system, I implemented a <strong>Hamburger Menu with an Overlay</strong>, which is a common and effective pattern for mobile and desktop screens. This menu style is compact on small screens and expands on larger ones, offering easy navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hamburger icon (three horizontal lines) serves as a toggle for the navigation links, which are hidden by default on smaller screens. On larger screens, the full navigation bar is visible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The decision to use this pattern is based on the need to save screen space on mobile devices, while still providing a simple, familiar navigation structure on desktop screens.
            </p>

        <!-- Cookie Consent Article -->
        <article class="design-content">
            <h1>Cookie Consent</h1>
            <p>
                The website features a cookie consent banner on the <strong>index.html</strong> page, informing users that cookies are used for improving their experience.
                However, if users click on the "Privacy Policy" or "Cookie Policy" links, they will be directed to a <strong>404 error page</strong> because the privacy policies are placeholders, not yet implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this is a simple website, I have not yet implemented full privacy or cookie policies, but these placeholders will be addressed as the website expands.
